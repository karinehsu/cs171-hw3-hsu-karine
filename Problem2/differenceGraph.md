Design Studio 2

Because the US Population Data is poorly estimated by the different organizations and people in the beginning years with quite a large variance, but then become much more accurate as time goes by, I decided to implement a design that showed the percentage differences in consensus versus the max and min of the estimates. I thought that using a bar chart where the size of the bar chart was proportional to the difference in consensus and max and min estimates would be best. 


Another visualization that could work is doing error bars that lie on top of the five separate lines so as to show the variability in the data compared to the consensus. 

I decided to overlay the error bar chart and the line graph next to each other like the line chart and area chart so that one could compare them side-by-side and allow for better comparisons for each year.
