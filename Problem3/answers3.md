1) Name the HTML element (type and class) that represents the interactive area.

The HTML element added when brush is implemented is the "brush" class that contains the background and extent classes. They are both of type rect. The interactive area is the background class. 

2) Name the HTML element (type and class) that is used for representing the selection.

The "extent" class is inside the "brush" class and is also of type rect. 

3) What are the other DOM elements for?

The two other DOM elements added are the resize e and resize w classes. The resize e class allows the user to change the selection on the right/east side, and the resize w class allows the user to change the selection on the left/west side.
